/**
* \file
* \brief Atomically and Non-Atomically Executed Code Blocks
* \date 4/17/2013
* 
* This header originated from an implementation for the AVR microcontroller. It has been ported to
* MSP430 and has identical functionality.
* 
* \note The macros in this header file require the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("ISO C99") feature of for loop
*     variables that are declared inside the for loop itself.  For that reason, this header file can
*     only be used if the standard level of the compiler (option --std=) is set to either \c c99 or
*     \c gnu99.
